VideoKit
===

Apple's video streaming solution is very limited - it supports only http streaming and h264 video codec, while being closed-source, rendering the task of streaming video much more difficult than it should be. This framework extends the native solution with the following: 

- Supports streaming protocols not supported natively 
- Supports additional codecs not covered by Apple's solution 
- Can be customized, configured and fine-tuned (such as buffering duration, audio or video raw data)

###You can purchase a commercial license at [VideoStreamSDK](http://videostreamsdk.com/).
